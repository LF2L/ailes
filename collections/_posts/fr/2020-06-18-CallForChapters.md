excerpt: "Call for Chapters - Book European Perspectives on Innovation Management"
---

It is the diversity of cultures within Europe that inspired us to explore what unites these approaches to innovation management and how they differ.  We invite scholar to contribute chapters, whether they are conceptual, positional, empirical or comparative, to look at specific characteristics of innovation in a regional, national and transnational context within Europe.  We are looking forward to receiving chapters about Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, Nippon-Rhineland, Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, etc. approaches to innovation management and settings; however, perspectives for this book are not limited to these.  Although there have been studies into this, they have not been brought together in a collection.
